PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Working at Wegmans with fruit production introduces the challenges of raw material weight and quantity of potential products.
At work, we tend to eyeball ingredients and hope that the provided materials can produce enough product to meet production goals.

SOLUTION:
An Android app designed to be run on a tablet inside the working environment. Programmed with Python and scaled to Android using Kivy.

APPROACH:
A nicely designed application (with UI/UX as a focus) that enables Wegmans employees with little to no technological experience to input all
starting ingredients at the start of a work day, and a convenient interface to regurlarly update inventory throughout the day. The coordinator
will be able to see all possible products that can be made with the given ingredients.
